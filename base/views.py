    You might wonder why you need a separate view, rather than relying on Django’s staticfiles app.
    The reason is that staticfiles only serves files from within the STATIC_URL prefix, like static/.

    Thus staticfiles can only serve /static/favicon.ico, whilst the favicon needs to be served at exactly /favicon.ico (without a <link>).

    Say if the project is accessed at an endpoint that returns a simple JSON and doesn't use the
    base.html file then the favicon won't show up.

    This endpoint acts as a fall back to supply the necessary icon at /favicon.ico

        settings.BASE_DIR / "static" / "assets" / "img" / "favicon.ico"
    ).open("rb")
    return FileResponse(file, headers={"Content-Type": "image/x-icon"})
